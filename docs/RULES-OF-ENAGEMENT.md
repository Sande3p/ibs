# Rules of Engagement

We are a small team. We strive to answer all questions in a timely manner. We also undersatnd that a certain issue might be of highest priority for you. But this is not an extension of IT Support. 

The intent is to make the engagement collaborative in nature.

* **Assume positive intent.** We ask community members to assume positive intent on the part of other people’s communications. We may disagree on details, but we expect all suggestions to be supportive of the community goals.
  
* **Respect participants.** We expect participants will occasionally disagree. Even if we reject an idea, we welcome everyone’s participation. Open Source projects are learning experiences. Ask, explore, challenge, and then respectfully assert if you agree or disagree. If your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter.
  
* **Welcoming to new members.** New members bring new perspectives. Some may raise questions that have been addressed before. Kindly point them to existing discussions. Everyone is new to every project once.
  
* **Be kind to beginners.** Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to engage kindly.
  
* **Consider your impact on others.** Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest.
  
* **Use words carefully.** We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. Poe’s Law suggests that without an emoticon people will misinterpret sarcasm. We ask community members to communicate plainly.
