Welcome to the **TOSCA Gitlab CI/CD to deploy on AWS** Challenge. In this challenge, we are looking for you to create Gitlab CI/CD pipeline to deploy Angular 2+ application on AWS using Weblogic 12c & Gradle.

_**Let us know any question you have!**_

#### Technology stack
* Angular 7
* AWS
* Weblogic 12c
* Gradle
* CI/CD
* Docker
* YAML


#### Prerequisites
* An AWS account. Members are requied to use their own AWS account.
* GitLab account.

#### References
* [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
* [Building Docker images with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html)

#### Resource & Links
* Angular 2+ application to be deployed is provided in forum
* Another Angular 2+ POC application built using *Gradle* & deployed on *Weblogic 12c* has be provided in forum.

#### Requirements

* Create a GitLab CI/CD pipeline  configured by a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml`. It should **test/lint** & **build** the Angular 2+ applicaiton after this is should will deploy the application on WebLogic 12c hosted on AWS.

* The CI/CD should make use of docker container that should have at least Java, Gradle and NodeJS to complete the build & deployment on a Webloc 12c server hosted on AWS.

* The CI/CD should be triggered whenever code push happens to the `staging` branch & it should do the following:
```
pipeline {

    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
		  		<Lint the code>
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                <Call Gradle Build Task>
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                <Deploy Build Result to Weblogic (Sandbox) & host on AWS>
            }
        }
    }
}
```
