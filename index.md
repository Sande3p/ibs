# IT Innovation Lab - Digital Blueprints

## What is it?

A research or proven technology framework that is re-usable by the community at large. The focus is on addressing the ‘how-to’ using the shortest path. 

A digital blueprint could be re-usable platform, application, library or an entire solution as well. 

It is an ongoing effort from the IT Innovation Lab to make some or most parts of a product we deliver useful and available to the community at large within HP.

The focus is on addressing two key outcomes

- Reusability.
- Technology that pushes or extends boundaries.

## Who is the audience?

IT and technology teams who find the the topic relevant in their day to day programs or addressing a growing need within their domains/business.

## When is it published?

Typically with every product that IT Innovation Lab delivers - so a new blueprint every month circa.
